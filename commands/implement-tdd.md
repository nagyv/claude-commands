Use the appropriate agent(s) to implement issue $ARGUMENTS. 

The agent(s) should follow TDD strictly with your coordination! First let it write the tests, then implement the code (Red - Green - Refactor), in small scopes. In the end, it
should add support for BDD tests, and ensure that the BDD tests described in the issue work too. 

Break these tasks up into multiple steps with TodoWriter, all to be delivered by your best fit software engineering agent. Enjoy the ride!

Example todos:

1. RED: Write failing tests for X
2. GREEN: Implement X
3. RED: Write failing tests for Y
4. GREEN: Implement Y
...
N-1. BDD: Implement and verify BDD test scenarios from the issue description
N. Refactor: Code cleanup, performance testing and optimizations
